            <p class="card-text">I just recently graduated high school, and dabbled a bit in some smaller languages in programming. I have always had a knack for computers, websites, and the internet which I feel is a crucial benefit in coding. My favorite hobby is astronomy. I own a celestron nexstar SE8 telescope and love learning more about planets in our solar system.</p>

          <h1>Skills</h1>
          <p>I am working to obtain a solid foundation in computer skills and programming. I was taught the basics through a branch of the flatiron course over the past 3 years. https://leetcode.com/torreykanko/

          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>I am currently working on a project with my telescope to capture the other 7 planets in the solar system with a camera. Some difficulties being the distance of the ice giants as well as capturing the main moons of each planet. I hope to use the images in the future with websites or my portfolio.
